Welcome to the Webonomics Workshop.

Everyone today is engaged in Online Shopping at Flipkart, Amazon, Jabong and
many more. It is really exciting to shop your favourites sitting in your bed.
But have you ever thought of opening your own E-commerce Company. I suppose it
would be even more exciting...!!

Today we are going to exactly do this. Open our very own E-commerce company.


But wait....!!!

It requires a website where users can login, browse through different products,
choose from what they want, and buy the things, just sitting back at their
homes. So we are going to make a fully functional e-commernce website of our
own.

So let us begin......
