External CSS
############

#.  In previous chapter we saw the usage of inline styles. 
#.  As the code grows it becomes difficult to manage both HTML and CSS in single document. 
#.  Hence a smarter way to work is to write the CSS in another sheet and embed link that sheet in the HTML document.
#.  To do this, their is a ``<link>`` tag in HTML which helps to link the external style sheet to be used in the HTML document for formatting.

Syntax
******

``<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="url">``

#.  URL in the above syntax is the location where the ``.css`` file is located.

#.  Similarly we can embed the javascripts as well in the HTML document.
