Is it possible to get O(1) time to access linked list


LinkedList is connection of a nodes in sequential manner.each noode ic connected to next node.So If we want to access a particular node,Then from first node to that node we are going forword by linkdlist functionality provides.

example:

LinkedList=1->2->3->7->32

In Above Example if We want to access the node 7 then we have to moved from first to seven as follows 

1-2-3-7

This takes O(n) complexity,
.

So There is need a another approach,The answer of qustion is it is possible to get O(1) time to access Linked List.

------->
First We Have To Create An Array

Array        [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
              !   !   !   !   !
              !   !   !   !   !
LinkedList    1   2   3   7   32


In array pointing the each and every node of linked list to the array.

And in Array we access any element in O(1) time.
