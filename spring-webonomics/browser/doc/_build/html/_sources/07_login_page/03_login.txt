Login Page
==========

#.  We will now work on the Login Page.

#.  We have see all the blocks and tags before, we just need to write the code 
    here.

#.  First let us write some CSS for our selves. 
    
.. note:: You can copy the CSS file from the reference directory.

.. literalinclude:: login.css
    :linenos:
    :language: css

#.  We will now create the login page. Here we will write everything and see the output.

.. note::   You have the login.html file in the reference directory. Refer it only in case of 
            confusions or errors.

.. literalinclude:: login.html
    :linenos:
    :language: html

#.  We now need to write the server side script which will connect to the database and see
    if the user is present in the data base or no. 

.. note::   You have the ``login.php`` in the reference directory. Refer only in case of errors
            or confusions.

.. literalinclude:: login.php
    :linenos:
    :language: php
