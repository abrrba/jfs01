Requirement

Let us have a look on the basic requirement of this page.

Our Final Page would look like this :

.. image:: images/login.png
   :height: 400px
   :width: 500px
   :align: center

``Note: The colors in the above image and our actual output may vary.``

Web Page should have -

#. A header with the company logo in the left and Company Name `Myzone.in` in
the center.
.. todo:: insert bullets properly

#. Color of the header part would be different from the body.

#. Then the heading `Login` will be in the center.

#. Two text box for `Username` and `Password` should be there, each with
respective label.

#. It will take input from the user to login to the website or to sign-up.

#. Two buttons below - One for SignIn and other for SignUp.

#. When the user sign-in, the query will be triggered to the **myzone_user**
database with the `username and password`.

#. If the user exists and password is correct, he is redirected to the `Main
Page`.

#. If the user is present, but the password is incorrect, it flags an error
message.

#. If the user is not present, it asks to sign-up, by taking the username and
password.

#. If then the username exists, it shows en error message, else an account is
created for that user, and he is redirected to the `Main Page`.

#. In the end, the footer has the website name with copyright information.
